# Credit Card Fraud Detection with XGBoost

This project uses XGBoost to detect fraudulent transactions from a credit card dataset.

## 🧠 Project Highlights
- Full ML pipeline using `ColumnTransformer` and `Pipeline`
- Hyperparameter tuning with `GridSearchCV` or `RandomizedSearchCV`
- Trained with `XGBoostClassifier`
- Dataset: [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

## 🔧 Files Included
- `EDA.ipynb`: Exploratory Data Analysis
- `pipeline.py`: Pipeline with model and hyperparameter tuning
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies used

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install dependencies:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the pipeline:  
   `python pipeline.py`

## 📝 Notes
- Dataset is large; `.csv` may be hidden on GitHub UI
- Consider using `.gitignore` to prevent tracking large `.csv` files
